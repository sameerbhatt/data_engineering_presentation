## 📚 Content Highlights

I've tried to create the presentation for beginers and added some real world examples for discussion. Though, it's not comprehensive and upto date (as things change pretty fast)!

**Note**:  This presentation is meant for educational purposes. The statistics quoted are fetched from LLMs and may not be true. There were multiple sources quoted by LLM and I didn't get the time to verify and add the exact link to the sources! Hence, all statistics should be verified to reflect current market conditions.

### Key Topics
